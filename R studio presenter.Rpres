Data Story
========================================================


Neil was a bright, sporty 13-year-old who loved playing rugby and swimming. He did swim training five times a week and also played for his school's rugby team. 

In November 2015, his life changed dramatically when he became suddenly unable to move his arm or speak at all. 
At the hospital, Neil's family were told he'd had a stroke, caused by a rugby tackle a few weeks earlier.

Neil says: "They asked me something I couldn't answer, and then I can't remember anything."
